```html
  <input type="hidden" name="TGPG_Code" value="Hey_World_Wuddup" />
  <input type="hidden" name="TGPG_Value" value="ayyyyyyyyyyy!" />
```

Include TGPG_Code (attribute code) and TGPG_Value (attribute value) in your action when you add a product to cart and it will add it as an attribute.

look into issues/ notes to self:
- You can't add the same product to cart again (i.e. i just added a regular version, AND a version w. attributes, attributes goes to 2nd line)
- add to work with adpm (quick/ easy)
- Clean up all code and re-evaluate code.
