  <input type="hidden" name="TGPG_Value" value="ayyyyyyyyyyy!" />
```

Include TGPG_Code (attribute code) and TGPG_Value (attribute value) in your action when you add a product to cart and it will add it as an attribute.

look into issues/ notes to self:
- You can't add the same product to cart again (i.e. i just added a regular version, AND a version w. attributes, attributes goes to 2nd line)
- add to work with adpm (quick/ easy)
- Clean up all code and re-evaluate code.
- if other products have the same attribute -- update them as necessary (i.e. they all update at the same time)
--- should this be an option or something?? if so, where!?
--- remove them too?!
--- check for inventory stuff so if 1 can't be updated, just return -1 for the action...?!
